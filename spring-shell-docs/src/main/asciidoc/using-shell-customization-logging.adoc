=== Logging

On default a _Spring Boot_ application will log messages into a console which
at minimum is annoying and may also mix output from a shell commands.
Fortunately there is a simple way to instruct logging changes via boot properties.

Completely silence console logging by defining its pattern as an empty value.

====
[source, yaml]
----
logging:
  pattern:
    console:
----
====

If you need log from a shell then write those into a file.

====
[source, yaml]
----
logging:
  file:
    name: shell.log
----
