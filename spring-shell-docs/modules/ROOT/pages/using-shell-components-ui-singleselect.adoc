= Single Select

ifndef::snippets[:snippets: ../../test/java/org/springframework/shell/docs]

A single select component asks a user to choose one item from a list. It is similar to a simple
dropbox implementation. The following listing shows an example:

====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{snippets}/UiComponentSnippets.java[tag=snippet6]
----

The following image shows typical output for a single select component:

The context object is `SingleItemSelectorContext`. The following table describes its context variables:

[[singleitemselectorcontext-template-variables]]
.SingleItemSelectorContext Template Variables
|===
|Key |Description

|`value`
|The returned value when the component exists.

|`rows`
|The visible items, where rows contains maps of name and selected items.

|`model`
|The parent context variables (see xref:using-shell-components-ui-render.adoc#selectorcomponentcontext-template-variables[SelectorComponentContext Template Variables]).
|===

You can pre-select an item by defining it to get exposed. This is
useful if you know the default and lets the user merely press `Enter` to make a choice.
The following listing sets a default:

====
[source, java, indent=0]
