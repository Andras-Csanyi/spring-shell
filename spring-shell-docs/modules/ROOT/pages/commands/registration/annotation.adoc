Classes annotated with `@Command` either on class or method level considered as _Configuration_ classes
for the shell application.

`@Command` annotation when used on a method marks it as a candidate for command registration.
In below example a command `example` is defined.

`@Command` annotation can be placed on a class which either defines defaults or shared settings
for `@Command` methods defined in a same class. In below example a command `parent example` is
defined.

Using a `@Command` will not automatically register command targets, instead it is required to use
`@EnableCommand` and/or `@CommandScan` annotations. This model is familiar from other parts
of Spring umbrella and provides better flexibility for a user being inclusive rather than exclusive
for command targets.

When only a certain commands need to be available in the application and others not, listing
the enabled _Configuration_ classes in `@EnableCommand` annotation makes them available, while 
the not listed ones remain disabled.

You can define target classes using `@CommandScan`. It will get picked from all _Configuration_
classes.

TIP: Define `@CommandScan` in Spring Boot `App` class on a top level and it will automatically
scan all command targets from all packages and classes under `App`.
