=== Reading Docs

Throughout this documentation, we make references to configuring something by using
annotations or programmatic examples.

NOTE: There are two annotation models, <<commands-registration-annotation, annotations>>
referred to new annotation model, <<commands-registration-legacyannotation, legacy annotations>>
referred to old legacy annotation model.

Old legacy annotation model mostly relates to use of `@ShellMethod` and `@ShellOption` and
new annotation model relates to use of `@Command`.

The programmatic model is how things are actually registered, even if you use annotations.

NOTE: Currently whole documentation structure is in transit to provide better
structure how things can be used using different ways to provide configurations.
So pardon a for little confusion now and there during a transit.
